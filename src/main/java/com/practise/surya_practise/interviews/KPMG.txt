coding test:
1.We have an numbers array. leading element=if all nos right to it are smaller. Find all leading elements in array.
2.We have an numbers array which contains 1's. Move all 1's to last(right side) of array.



L1 round:
public void Main{
psvm(String args[]){
int n=10;
rec(n)
}
}

public void rec(int n){
if(n==0){
	return;
}
SOP(n);
return rec(n-1);
}

hashmap internal impl:
k1->el1, el2

hashCode=hashFunction(key)

key1, value1
key2, value2
key3, value3

collision resolution techniques
hashset time complexities

DSA questions:
move 1's to last in arr[]
find all great elements of int[] where great element is the one which is greater than all the elements on its right.

To be learnt:
java core concepts & internal working, sets, hashmaps, trees, problem solving, DSA: dp,sliding window.

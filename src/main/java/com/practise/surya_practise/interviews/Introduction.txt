//momi merge accounts injection for nurse app to OCR payments for order & inventory with billing

Good morning/afternoon [Interviewer's Name/Team]
and Hi
As you know my name is suryateja. I am Java Developer with around 3 years
in building scalable microservices architectures and performance-optimized applications,
in healthcare domain. Currently, I'm working as a Software Development Engineer at Valeo Wellbeing Technologies in Bangalore.


Let me explain some of the important features that I worked on:
In our company we used to have monolithic system and it would lead to more time consuming deployements
, frequent prod bugs and a blocker for scalability. So, we have to split this into microservices.
How we did this is, first listed all the tables schema, then we discussed on how many microservices has to be built based on our traffic and finalised to create 3 microservices: user, catalog, order
Then we segragated tables according to each microservice and developed APIs for those tables.

I implemented SEO feature where I combined seo data of multiple tables into single table and implemented data migration for that.
I implemented authentication feature in website & app with google, apple, email-password options.
• Integrated Paymob for payments, Freshsales for CRM, Unicommerce for inventory & order management
and Zoho Books for billing automation
• Built Nurse app backend with Google Maps real-time ETA + OTP — improved nurse
efficiency 60%
• Detected and blocked active abuse of search APIs (150 GB/day Elasticsearch egress);
implemented IP filtering, mandatory headers, rate limiting, payload validation and prepared
statements — fully stopped the exploit
• Engineered OCR pipeline (Spring Boot + Tesseract) for 8 labs — eliminated 80% manual
data entry

• Recently, I worked on feature called merge accounts. In which a user having multiple accounts requests to keep only single account and move all orders, reports, results data to primary account.
This will be requested to Customer Support team & they do it from our admin panel.
Since there are many db updations in many tables to complete this API, I implemented it in asynchronous way.
Once we send in progress status to Frontend then in backend I created a multiple threads to start db updation in entities to process some of them to run in parallel and others in sequential
Overall I should achieve consistent database state even if some db updation failed for one entity.
In case of failures, I roll backed all other updations that are completed. S


Prior to this, I did an internship at IIT Bombay as Java Microservcies Intern
where I built User microservice with authentication and Role Based Access Control.

### 🎤 **2-Minute STAR-Based Version**

Good morning/afternoon!
I’m **Suryateja**, a **Java Developer** with around **3 years of experience** in building scalable microservices and performance-optimized applications in the **healthcare domain**.
I currently work as a **Software Development Engineer** at **Valeo Wellbeing Technologies** in Bangalore.

One of my key projects was **migrating our monolithic application to microservices**.
Initially, deployments were slow and caused frequent production issues.
To solve this, our team analyzed the database schema and split the system into **User, Catalog, and Order services**.
I was responsible for segregating tables, creating APIs, and setting up inter-service communication.
This change made our system much more **scalable**, **fault-tolerant**, and **easier to deploy**.

Another major project I handled was the **Merge Accounts feature**.
The goal was to merge data from multiple user accounts into a single one without data loss.
I built an **asynchronous API** using **multithreading** in Spring Boot — some updates ran in parallel, others sequentially, with rollback handling for failures.
This ensured **data consistency** and eliminated manual work for the support team.

I also worked on improving **security and automation** —
I mitigated a **SQL injection attack** on our search API by implementing payload validation, IP filtering, and prepared statements, which fully stopped the exploit.
Additionally, I built an **OCR pipeline** using **Spring Boot and Tesseract** to extract data from lab PDFs, cutting **80% of manual entry**.

Before this, I interned at **IIT Bombay**, where I built a **User Microservice** with authentication and **Role-Based Access Control** using custom annotations — a great foundation for secure microservice design.

Overall, my experience has strengthened my skills in **Java, Spring Boot, Microservices, API integrations, and system performance optimization**, and I’m now looking to take on challenging backend or full-stack roles that focus on scalability and clean architecture.
